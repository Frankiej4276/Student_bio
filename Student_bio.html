    <p>I was born in the year of 1996 in the city of Petersburg. I was raised by my mother
        for the first few years until she met my step-father. I grew up in Colonial Heights, 
        Prince george, and Hopewell. I graduated high school in 2014, and after graduation I 
        immediately started working. In 2015 I met the love of my life, Michelle.
        On October 19th of 2017, I gave Michelle my last name. My life is only just beginning,
        right now I share a home with my wife, and our son Rocky. (Who is a dog)
